# XYZReader
An app for implementing Android Material Design philosophies.  This is a basic feed reader, with dummy data for a demonstration of the UI only.  This could be connected to a real backend for providing the latest of your feeds.

## Code Example

This application uses Material Design philosophies to try and produce a visually appealing feed reader, along with the right movements, colors, fonts, and buttons.
This app uses a SwipeRefreshLayout, RecyclerView, Cardviews, FloatingActionButtons, Styles, CollapsingToolbarLayout, CoordinatorLayout, and a Toolbar.
Much of the backend was provided in the form of a template from Udacity.

## Motivation

This app is a result of a Material Design Course as part of my Android nanodegree through Udacity and Google.  I modified the supplied app template provided by Udacity in order to practice creating visually beautiful material design based UI.

## Installation

Import this app into Android Studio and install onto device.

## API Reference

For more information on Material Design please see the [Google documentation.](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)

## Contributors

Udacity.com supplied the template and majority of the code for the app.  I simply *made it Material*.
